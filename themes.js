No, no, no, no.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start on human terms and just say we're going to find a way forward on this or...\n[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be on the front of the newspaper I can assure you because I've got all the documentation and I've been on the front of the newspaper sadly before and I've never even contacted the newspaper ever before it's just my story is so stupid my best friend's been murdered through this since 2023 I don't need a comment on this I need a way forward and that you're phoning up actually to provide some support and say I've looked through your case it's really terrible Maya\n[SPEAKER_01]: I have looked through your case, Maya, and I am really sorry to hear about the concerns.\n[SPEAKER_00]: The concerns you're calling are concerns.\n[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good enough, I'm afraid.\n[SPEAKER_00]: That's really terrible to claim that I've got concerns.\n[SPEAKER_00]: not that I've got a medical condition already diagnosed in 2005.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Mya, I am trying to help you today.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you just interrupt me while I'm explaining the key bit of the history so I can't actually have it.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I am up to date with the history of it Mya.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I've looked through your whole entire case today.\n[SPEAKER_00]: What happened in 2005 then?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Have I got a diagnosis from 2005 and not?\n[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing I will ask and then we'll just drop it.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Have I got a diagnosis from 2005 or not?\n[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have access to your medical records?\n[SPEAKER_01]: I am just talking\n[SPEAKER_01]: I am just talking purely about the complaint that you have raised with us.\n[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason for the call today.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And you realize that I know how this complaint's been left with by Gemma and the way that you're dealing with it at the moment is not how it got left with and I'm just asking one simple question.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Do you accept that I have a real legal diagnosis from 2005 or not?\n[SPEAKER_01]: That's not within my authority to confirm.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not clinically trained.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking whether you're clinically trained or anything trained.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying I've got a legal diagnosis from 2005.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Do you accept that or not?\n[SPEAKER_01]: I accept that the concerns that you raise have been your complaint.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask you one last time.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I have a diagnosis, a legal diagnosis.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I am not clinically trained.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here just to purely talk about the complaint today.\n[SPEAKER_01]: You're just here to wind me up, aren't you?\n[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just here just to purely talk about the complaint today and let you know of the updates that have happened.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I haven't agreed to any of this.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I know where I've left this complaint with NHS England.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I know the entire thing.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So you now tell me how you're going to disable this completely and utterly, because I got told you were really, really good.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You've had experience on this before and that you were going to be empathetic and caring, and this is not\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I am really sorry.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I am sorry that you feel like I'm not being empathetic and caring.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you phone up someone like this?\n[SPEAKER_00]: He knows, there's got so many years behind this just to abuse them.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Is this fun?\n[SPEAKER_01]: Mya, I am trying to help as much as possible.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Have I got a diagnosis from 2005 or not?\n[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not able to confirm that, Mya.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I am not clinically trained.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Can you accept what I'm saying or not?\n[SPEAKER_01]: I do accept that.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can just move on.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Why did that take five minutes?\n[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have to advise you that I'm not clinically trained.\n[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have access to your medical records.\n[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't say whether you have a diagnosis or not.\n[SPEAKER_01]: That's not within our power here at the Customer Contact Centre.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want me to email this right now through to you now so you can actually just go, yes, no, you've got a diagnosis.\n[SPEAKER_00]: We can just move on from that.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be able to confirm that either.\n[SPEAKER_01]: That is not within our role at the Customer Contact Centre.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I really just want to go through the complaint today and the updates that we have.\n[SPEAKER_00]: have.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I know you really want to do that and just get off for the weekend.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I got told by Gemma we've got an hour and a half to two hours on this phone call.\n[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I got told.\n[SPEAKER_01]: You may not have got told, but... An hour and a half or two hours.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've just... And I know you've just got... Well, I mean, that's not what I got told.\n[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to provide you with an update, Maya.\n[SPEAKER_01]: We obviously haven't received your timeline.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to provide me with an update?\n[SPEAKER_00]: You have.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You've got my email right there in front of you.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I just got told I was going to get an email apology on Friday.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you accept that.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you've received that from Gemma.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when?\n[SPEAKER_00]: When did I receive that?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Now?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Seven days later or not?\n[SPEAKER_01]: It was this morning, yes, that's correct.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and so I was meant to receive it last Friday, wasn't I?\n[SPEAKER_00]: None of this is going well.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I can only apologize on Gemma's behalf.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I can obviously feed that back to her and let her know.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so as a consequence of that, I must reply to that email with the timeline.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I got told by Gemma that you're going to actually go through the case with me today and find a way forward, and instead you're just providing me an update of why you're going on holiday.\n[SPEAKER_01]: That is not what I stated, Maya.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say I was going on holiday.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So, because you said...\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Maya, can you please just let me speak and just advise with the update?\n[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reason for the call today.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You've told me it's an update rather than actually a way forward, which is not, you know, that's what I agreed with Gemma in a documented call.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I have now seen that you have provided an email.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just reading it now.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Just bear with me.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not just a doll to be... We haven't received... Maya, we haven't received a timeline still.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Great.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I've just told... Have I not told you in this conversation that I've now got a 1,000 page... 1,000 pages worth of timeline?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Have I told you in this document... Documented phone call, yes?\n[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but you also stated that it was within the email that you've just sent as well.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Right.\n[SPEAKER_01]: because we haven't received it yet.\n[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing further that we can do regarding that.\n[SPEAKER_00]: However... Is there a folder in the email or not where you can access the timeline?\n[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't sent the timeline over.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't.\n[SPEAKER_01]: There's no folder in within the email.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So this email I have sent over to Gemma that you've just mentioned\n[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it says thank you for the email, though I must express how troubling it is to receive such a delayed and dismissive response to what was a profoundly degrading and harmful experience.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm now providing secure access to the timeline via this link.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Please contact me directly.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I give up.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you've said, could we start over again, please?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there.\n[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Maya.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you calling?\n[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm calling today because obviously I've taken over your case from Kerry.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and I can see that you did request a call back from myself when you had the conversation with Gemma, just to discuss how we can move forward with your complaint.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Weeks ago, and I agreed that with Kerry, we were going to move forward the complaint.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Is Kerry okay?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Or should I never mention that ever again?\n[SPEAKER_01]: I have to specify that information, unfortunately.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Great.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Maya, because you sent your phone to the legal team, NHS England's legal team, they have requested that we await for their response to your complaint.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.\n[SPEAKER_00]: No further action.\n[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean their response?\n[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, sorry, you're not even looking into my complaint now.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You phone me up to say that you're not even looking into it.\n[SPEAKER_01]: We are waiting for the team to provide their response to the concerns that you sent directly over to them.\n[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't spoken to me for the past nine days and I've been calling them every single day.\n[SPEAKER_00]: The first time when I spoke with them, the receptionist said, it's so terrible what you've been through.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And another recorded, documented phone call.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mentioned that I've recorded and documented every single one of these phone calls, transcribed them, logged them, and analyzed them.\n[SPEAKER_00]: they're refusing to speak with me as well.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid that as I've cited the NHS England legal team, I did not cite sir, no.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I said so.\n[SPEAKER_01]: No.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I said so.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You inserted the wrong thing, sadly.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize, but as I stated, the legal team have advised that we need to... Who's the legal team?\n[SPEAKER_00]: What's his name?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Or her name?\n[SPEAKER_01]: ...England's legal team.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Can I have their names, please?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Emily.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Emily.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And what's her second name?\n[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not afraid.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid I'm not able to give out that information.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You have to, because you've clearly said... I'm not.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of NHS England's policy.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it is, because you've said that we're going to court and that I only get a single... I don't get a surname when I'm going to court.\n[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Can I take a surname from your... Oh, well, I've already got your surname.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's Kimberly Walsh.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently you were meant to be a transgender specialist and you've found out the worst case in the entire UK.\n[SPEAKER_00]: To tell one, please, the floor is yours.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that is the only information that we do have currently.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You've gone through all my records.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You have read everything.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gone through your records.\n[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't have access to that.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You've gone through all my case notes without even sort of consent.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You are really a case handler.\n[SPEAKER_01]: We don't require your consent in order to look through the case notes that we have on our system.\n[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a load of abuse and that Kerry Green has stepped down and refused to even look at all of this and then... She's off sick currently at the moment.\n[SPEAKER_00]: She hasn't stepped down.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's all I need to know.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I hope she's okay because she was a lot better.\n[SPEAKER_00]: She was a lot, you know, actually wanted to get this progressed and sorted and I just, I just don't know.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, once we receive an update from the legal team, then obviously I can get in contact with you and provide that update.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So there they are lit.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not having a go at you here at all.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I was really looking forward to getting sort of a way forward.\n[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I got left with Gemma was sort of to find a way forward.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're telling me that instead we live in a world full of lawyers that can dictate both how you're going to be sort of dictated along terms going forward, but equally sort of what happens with me and my sort of absolute sort\n[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare that's not here.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Can I say one point that may make?\n[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you can.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So I have obviously, you know, through possibly all the records that you've accessed, I would suggest illegally, not yourself, but you know, you've been provided illegally.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that I am sort of, I have followed this up for sort of well over 23 years.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you'll agree potentially.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You don't, you know, don't dismiss what I'm saying.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I have spoken with everybody at the General Medical Council, everyone at the Nursing Midwifery Council, everyone at the HCPC.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I know the PSA inside and out and I equally know the CQC, all of them.\n[SPEAKER_00]: There's hundreds of people at work now.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I know them all by name.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You understand through this abuse, one person was going to speak with everybody and document it all.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So I have fortunately sort of, I don't know, I'm just getting to my point.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I have spoken with the CQC and they are sort of over at least 15 years.\n[SPEAKER_00]: They have taken my case on, do you understand?\n[SPEAKER_00]: I was expecting NHS complaints to take it on.\n[SPEAKER_00]: But the CQC, and I'm just going to get to my point, they've taken it on.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you understand that.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately,\n[SPEAKER_00]: i over all the time and my dad used to be in the chest in my family really do live in the biggest house in hollywood they had it demolished and they had a bill even bigger it's so stupid i've got a first-class honors degree of three postgraduate qualifications over this time sadly while trying to sort of insure that abuse doesn't happen to anybody else ever again and you know it's all that this is all reported documented not me other people could i just i'd pick up so many people being abused and it just being ignored\n[SPEAKER_00]: I have developed through the silly AI systems and software, of which I know them really, really, really well.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just AI, it's just software 3.0, where all the hardware has increased massively, and so the software jumps straight up to it.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, to cut a long story short, I have developed an amazing entire system, but the CQC have said they're going to adopt for complaints, so they don't have to speak to anybody ever again.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely mind-blowing, what I've actually been able to put together\n[SPEAKER_00]: not because you know for the many smarter than anybody else is just that the technology is actually here so i don't have to do any of the coding and i just say i need this to document all of this can we get this can we get this visualization and then the cqc of all people are very very ridiculous high level of them said that they're going to adopt it so how can i just uh... complaints coming along when they're just finding out the blue to tell me another person's read through all my notes without any kind of consent\n[SPEAKER_00]: and claim you don't need any incorrect uh... played before he was again i've done a lot uh... i think you've taken the week off now i haven't taken a week off well brilliant so you've got me up to tell me some support please tell me from the up to give me some kind of support could you have a will just curtail this entire conversation\n[SPEAKER_01]: So this phone call isn't out of the blue.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that you spoke with my manager Gemma last week and agreed to time which was 2pm this Friday.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Are you NHS complaints or are you just sort of NHS legal sort of dekularisation?\n[SPEAKER_01]: No, so we are NHS England's complaints team obviously regarding the specialised services.\n[SPEAKER_01]: No, so it seems like we've got documentation that you've... Go on.\n[SPEAKER_01]: We've got documentation that you forwarded all your concerns to the NHS England legal team.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they are currently... How long do you want me to carry this on for?\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shutting up.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very high medical condition.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to shut up.\n[SPEAKER_01]: They're still investigating into your concerns.\n[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't contacted me once, so yes they are, but I'm sure they're doing other people's concerns.\n[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing this in the background, Mya.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Mya, it is currently under review.\n[SPEAKER_01]: This is the reason why we have to wait for that review until we can then go into our complaint here.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've read through all my documentation, and you're not even saying, look, it's terrible, and we're going to get back into it.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not leaving this case.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there for you, Myra, as soon as the legal team allow me to.\n[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're going to have to say, yeah?\n[SPEAKER_01]: That is completely correct, yes.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Go on, then.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say so much for you on your behalf, do I?\n[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Maya.\n[SPEAKER_01]: That is the only update that we do have currently.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand the update, okay?\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to be pedantic, but I'm asking because I've talked too much and I've got my other issues.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I am really going to shut up.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to ask you because I thought this was an hour and a half conversation.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You're now taking the rest of the day off and the rest of Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Can you, just for a third time, I am kind of under the impression, but I have interrupted too much.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to shut up.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you phoning?\n[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was an agreed phone call to give you an update on the complaint.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And then you gave me that update just for a third time so I'm absolutely clear.\n[SPEAKER_01]: So we are dealing with your complaint but we cannot give an update regarding investigating into your complaint currently as we are waiting for advice from our legal team.\n[SPEAKER_00]: When will you receive that legal advice?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Is that based on when I provide a timeline?\n[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have an actual time frame on that unfortunately so but I can give you an update.\n[SPEAKER_01]: We are waiting for an update back from our legal team, which we do take once a week.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Which is going to take place once a week?\n[SPEAKER_01]: No, we take the team once a week.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just saying, so will I then get an update when Emily declares it's okay for me to be transgender?\n[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.\n[SPEAKER_01]: We will make contact with you as soon as she provides that update.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And when was the last update she provided?\n[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just have a look.\n[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the 23rd, so two days ago, she just stated that she would let us know if the solicitors require anything further because I sent over a timeline of your entire case.\n[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I know the timeline of this case and also the documentation is provided to us as well.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Who sent over a timeline?\n[SPEAKER_01]: I sent over a timeline from when this complaint started to where we are right now.\n[SPEAKER_01]: because that's what they requested.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You have made up a timeline about my medical records without ever speaking with me and sending it over.\n[SPEAKER_01]: What you do with your medical records is regarding the complaints\n[SPEAKER_01]: So the first time you contacted us regarding this complaint and then the last update on this?\n[SPEAKER_00]: When was the first time?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know everything was documented.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It was in October 2023.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It was documented and recorded.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Not regarding this complaint that we have here, Maya, it was the 6th of March this year.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're lying about that because I'm going to just say, because I have this all documented.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It was refused between October and March.\n[SPEAKER_00]: They claimed that Tavistock were commissioning the Trans Plus.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I had to dispute that over five different phone conversations between October and March, and what you've said is absolutely incorrect based on all the call logs.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you were going to say that because that's what they're going to try and claim.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's only since March.\n[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's since October.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I have all of this documented, so when you are claiming that, you phone me up just to sort\n[SPEAKER_00]: essentially just aggravate me.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Can you understand that potentially this wasn't, this was actually accepted by your silly NHS complaints people back in March, but I actually brought this up in October and in the single other previous month because I knew that NHS complaints have to look at this.\n[SPEAKER_00]: What you've just said there is absolutely offensive.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I do apologize about that, Maya, but because this is the case I'm currently looking after, it only goes back to March of this year.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the records from October?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm telling you, I've phoned them up so many times.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not being difficult.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm not stating anything, Maya.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just stating that I am really sorry about that.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So why did you send it over to the legal team stating that?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's not true.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's not true!\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lie!\n[SPEAKER_01]: They asked for a timeline of this complaint.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And you made up a face one!\n[SPEAKER_01]: This complaint.\n[SPEAKER_01]: that that is the reason why I sent over the timeline from the information I can see, Maya.\n[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only information I can see.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all the calls transcribed.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Can I send over one piece of documentation over to you?\n[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, yeah.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.\n[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll forward it to legal for you.\n[SPEAKER_00]: If you forward it to legal, you're going to have to also apologize for putting in a false timeline.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I really truly have, because I'm such a pedantic person, I've got a first-class honours degree.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I know you say it may not matter.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It really does when you actually do loads of education.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It changes you forever.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote 50 people's dissertations for them, for free, to stop them from crying.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's neither here nor there.\n[SPEAKER_00]: On this, I have five different calls with NHS England prior to March, claiming that I know of the regulations, that I have spoken with TransPlus,\n[SPEAKER_00]: my best friend's been murdered through all of this.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to just forget about this whatsoever.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And I am going to obviously now have to, I've got, I stopped because I am going off on two, there's a couple of different things and I appreciate you listening to me, but I waited for Gemma's email because she claimed she was going to email me on Friday.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And I already had a 23 page email ready to go sort of with Gemma with the past conversations I had with her all analyzed.\n[SPEAKER_00]: every single bit that she sort of was re-agreed on and I felt sort of I just I gave her a chance because I was putting together a timeline and the way she spoke to me at the very end was quite sort of good and she mentioned how wonderful you were which I am still waiting for but I'm waiting for this apology that's only been received within the last few hours and she's claimed she had to go off on holiday and I'm a training doll but\n[SPEAKER_00]: Within that conversation as well, you know, I did not send through this sort of detailed 23 page document, but just, just for Gemma's own sake, because I'm trying to sort of move and progress this actual case.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So you deal with this case, I've never dealt with the Gen, but I didn't send that through.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I, I, I got sort of, as I say, sort of 600 pages.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's now 400, 400 on, 400 worth of evidence.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thousand pages.\n[SPEAKER_00]: so i think that what kind of documentation to only just stop doing here with the timeline with every single thing documented all the high people up in it and i think that England gmc linda white all recorded and documented i'm saying that for the very the final part and i appreciate you just hearing me out but when i have to send to a giant silly page of documentation showing not one but five different times i've heard of nhs england i've got pdf files that i could just access now\n[SPEAKER_00]: when did I phone NHS England?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was on this day, this day, this day.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I think then, and I don't need to do any of this anymore, but I can then just go on sort of a Mac finder and say sort of, when were these specific calls?\n[SPEAKER_00]: What I can do is just, I know photographically what I said in these calls, so I can just search in finder with quotes, three specific words that are said in a sentence, and it'll come up with the entire transcript from NHS England just like that.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all of these\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just stunned that you would sort of claim this and I appreciate the apology, but you sent through a timeline through to sort of the legal team.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to send through an email to them at some stage following this today and with me copied in claiming that timeline was just an estimation and a guess.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Because now they're thinking that, oh, I just make little random complaints.\n[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is about my life.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it was facts from the case that I had access to obviously.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken this over from Kerry.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize that I haven't looked at previous correspondence from you.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Because our phone call was put in for tonight, Maia.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so you contacted NHS England, sort of NHS Legal, without ever contacting me and put in a false timeline and where the... Okay, well, Maia, if you want to send any information over, you're more than welcome, but I'm more than happy to send that email to Legal.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be able to copy you into it, unfortunately, so just because it is an internal email, but I'm more than happy.\n[SPEAKER_01]: to have a look through our previous correspondence with you, because we also would have a record of these.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And I can add that to the timeline for you.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And no, it doesn't start getting, I mean, which bits, I'm just going to say that I always try and find a way forward and productive.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And this piece of software is going to put out so many people out of business in terms of, it just does everything so ridiculously simple and works.\n[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully the QCQC, if they don't take it up,\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to say this to you.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It just records and documents all the abuses.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You can press then one button and it will produce all the different legal papers.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's phenomenal.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back onto the track, I can't just have you start making up a second timeline that isn't agreed with me, can I?\n[SPEAKER_00]: If you send over the information, I'll be more than happy to forward that to them.\n[SPEAKER_00]: So you're now my, you're not my secretary, and you're meant to be doing it with Trans Plus, so that's incorrect.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm just, I know these processes inside out.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, as I said on this part of the conference conversation, trying to find a constructive and productive way forward, and at no stage am I finding this.\n[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just trying to, I really appreciate you just hearing me out, so I'm just trying to finish on this point.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 33 page timeline.\n[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant to be five to six pages, but because there's so much abuse in there, it's all come from absolute strategic sort of evidence documentation.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the top media school, I know it doesn't mean anything to you.\n[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, I would send this, if this was absolutely diamond and sort of\n[SPEAKER_00]: gold-encrusted sort of that i've been able to go back to it three times just to ensure that everything on there is absolutely correct but i don't want anything on there that you know sort of half of incorrect or there is a mistake at the moment it i have never seen anything like it uh... in terms of just the documentation and uh... if there's so much abuse i have had to stop myself crying lots and lots of times i'm an extremely extremely strong person the eldest person in my family\n[SPEAKER_00]: and i think the second national martial arts uh... several times i have a really amazing short time line here but that's the reason for the provide everything you could ever want it someone at that the contacted me reached out sort of when jemma said that she was you have this timeline with you if you've actually contacted not yourself i'm not going to go you could you've just jumped in here claiming that emily's going to dictate whether i get transgender health care or not\n[SPEAKER_00]: What on earth, how on earth do we go forward because this is my best bet going forward that I stick this all, I essentially just go back and contact NHS Legal and you're saying we're still not looking into your complaint at all and the timeline is absolutely incorrect and I will send that evidence through my two points here.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for listening, following me hopefully on this.\n[SPEAKER_00]: i've got to stop now to find evidence about how you know sort of the at all with the nhs times i've contacted method it's got nothing to do with it at the people that it's so stupidly documented uh... equally the other thing is i can now sort of just take it's wonderful that the system now but i can just take all the family all the timeline and just upload it into this program software and it visualizes it all and it visualizes it all amazingly so uh...\n[SPEAKER_00]: How, you, I mean, it doesn't seem, because you're not looking into the case, because you haven't contacted Trans Plus and it enabled them to just go after the children that they've abused, but that's a different issue.\n[SPEAKER_00]: How are you taking through sort of any of the timeline now?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Because you haven't got sort of, there is no, you haven't provided, you clearly said in this phone conversation, you don't want the timeline and you'd prefer to make up your own.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say that, Maya.\n[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to send in your own timeline about when you did that because you offered to do that, I stated that I've only looked into this complaint from when it was logged\n[SPEAKER_01]: and then I've sent that timeline over.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're not happy with the timeline.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You're more than welcome to send over a timeline.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going to send through a timeline, but that's my point, which is I thank you for just getting to that thing, which is you are now stating that almost in a way that you're going to take control over this entire thing, and please, you know, say the other thing, but you're going to now contact NHS Legal to say that the timeline is just a rough estimate and is not actually the timeline that should be considered.\n[SPEAKER_00]: and it may be quite a few things wrong on that and didn't speak to me beforehand and equally then you're going to try and wait for a timeline for me which you're not even going to be able to look at or read because you haven't even you know that you phone me up claiming that you aren't even properly allocated on the case and that you're just accessing my details whether you like you know whether I like it or not that's the fact the whole of this you know if I please put yourself in my situation you just be wound up by this silly conversation\n[SPEAKER_00]: especially considering you're being paid for this.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, as I've stated, Maya, we have never said we're not going to look into this complaint.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, when did you say... We are speaking about the legal team.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I know.\n[SPEAKER_01]: So, until we've got that response from the legal team, we can't go forward.\n[SPEAKER_00]: But you've provided them both legal information.\n[SPEAKER_01]: And I've stated if you want to provide... No, you've stated in your audit report...\n[SPEAKER_00]: this whole conversation that we're having i have to contact the mhs legal now within the next two hours with the city rubbish timeline in terms of it's just abuse all i've received is abuse throughout this entire thing and you've railroaded this entire process by claiming to if this was anybody else to be included in the be really upset you get your way i'm sorry but that you know i went when i was at the top media school i ever mentioned again i was the top graduate there and everybody's project\n[SPEAKER_00]: I just said, yeah, and thank you ever so much for setting this all up.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I got, it doesn't matter.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go to from here?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know what you're going to do, and then you're going to sort of get large sums of money for doing whatever you are doing, which from my perspective is nothing.\n[SPEAKER_00]: From an actual perspective.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's not appropriate.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I've advised you what I'm going to do today, which is- That's not appropriate.\n[SPEAKER_00]: How's that not appropriate?\n[SPEAKER_00]: Go on.\n[SPEAKER_00]: How's all being paid for this?\n[SPEAKER_00]: process.\n[SPEAKER_00]: You've stalled this from Kerry and you're saying that... I haven't stalled it at all.\n[SPEAKER_01]: As per your conversation with Gemma, we were waiting for that timeline.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I've now received that.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for that.\n[SPEAKER_00]: As per the timeline, as per everything, Gemma was meant to email me on Friday.\n[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're getting back to her.\n[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm trying to say is you're sending an email to Emily just to say that maybe the timeline is not complete.\n[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say that you feel like the timeline.\n[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not going to feel because you haven't even accepted me.\n[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so there's nothing further I can help you today.\n[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean there's nothing further?\n[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot get any updates until I get a further response from you, okay?\n[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.\n[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, you're hanging up on me?\n",

    "description": "🍚 Perfect Rice Every Time: \nStep-by-Step: Perfect Rice Every Time 1. Measure Your Rice • Standard serving: 1 cup uncooked rice = 2 to 3 servings • Always use the same cup or bowl to measure rice and water (helps with ratios). ⸻ 2. Rinse (Always Recommended) • Why: Removes excess starch for fluffier, separate grains. • How: • Place rice in a bowl or fine-mesh sieve. • Cover with cold water. • Gently swish with your hand, pour off cloudy water. • Repeat 3–5 times until the water runs mostly clear. ⸻ 3. Soak (Optional, but Recommended for Certain Rices) • Soaking improves texture, especially for: • Basmati (15–30 minutes) • Short-grain Japanese rice (20–40 minutes) • How: After rinsing, cover rice with clean water and let it sit. Drain before cooking. • Skip soaking for jasmine and long-grain white rice unless the brand recommends it. ⸻ 📏 Water Ratios (Standard Rule of Thumb) Rice Type | Ratio (Rice:Water) | Notes — Basmati 1:1.5 Use less water if soaking — Jasmine 1:1.25 No soaking, absorbs fast — Short-grain rice 1:1.1–1.2 Soak first; less water needed — Long-grain white 1:2 Standard American white rice — Brown rice 1:2.25 Needs longer cooking time 🔥 Method 1: Stovetop Absorption (Lid On) – Classic — Best for: Basmati, jasmine, long-grain, and Japanese rice. 1. Add rice and measured water to a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid. 2. Bring to a boil (medium-high heat), uncovered. 3. Once boiling, stir once, then reduce heat to very low, cover tightly. 4. Simmer gently (no peeking!) for: • White rice: 12–15 minutes • Brown rice: 40–45 minutes 5. Remove from heat and let sit 10 minutes (still covered). 6. Fluff with a fork or paddle. ⸻ 🍳 Method 2: Rice Cooker – Easiest & Most Consistent — Best for: Any rice. Ideal for Japanese-style or regular rice lovers. 1. Rinse and optionally soak. 2. Use the built-in markings or stick to standard ratios. 3. Close the lid and hit cook. 4. Let it sit for 10 minutes after it switches to keep warm. Note: Some cookers auto-adjust based on moisture. Don’t open it early. ⸻ 🫕 Method 3: Pilaf or Toasted Rice Method (Flavorful) — Best for: Long-grain or basmati when cooking with broth. 1. Rinse rice (skip soaking). 2. Heat a bit of oil or butter in the pan. 3. Add rice and lightly toast for 2–3 minutes. 4. Add hot water or stock (follow ratio). 5. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook 15 minutes. 6. Let rest and fluff. ⸻ 💨 Method 4: Microwave Method (Quick) — Best for: Jasmine or long-grain rice in small amounts. 1. Use a microwave-safe bowl with a loose-fitting lid. 2. Add 1 cup rice, 1.5–2 cups water. 3. Microwave uncovered on high for 10 minutes. 4. Then medium for 10 more minutes. 5. Let rest, fluff with a fork. ⸻ ♨️ Method 5: Boiling Like Pasta (Failproof) — Best for: Long-grain or basmati. Great if you don’t want to worry about water ratios. 1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (like pasta). 2. Add rinsed rice and boil uncovered: • White rice: 10–12 minutes • Brown rice: 25–30 minutes 3. Drain and return to the pot with lid on to steam 5–10 min. ⸻ 📝 Final Tips • Avoid stirring while cooking (makes rice gummy). • Always rest rice after cooking to allow moisture to redistribute. • For sushi rice, add a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt after cooking.",
